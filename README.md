# Alabama-Campaign-Finance-Contribution-Analysis-in-R
Analysis of campaign finance contribution data for the 2016 presidential election cycle in R. 

Data was downloaded from the FEC's API here: http://classic.fec.gov/disclosurep/PDownload.do as a csv. 
Then it was loaded into RStudio, where I did cleaning and analysis. 

The main project file is the R Markdown document. You can view the final knitted R markdown document at Rpubs here: https://rpubs.com/jacobdodd/alcampaignfinance or download the knitted html file.

I hope you enjoy reading this project, and all feedback is welcome!
